### Nested Schema for `replication_durability_constraints`

Read-Only:

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = planetscale_keyspace.my_planetscale_keyspace
  id = jsonencode({
    branch = "..."
    database = "..."
    name = "..."
    organization = "..."
  })
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import planetscale_keyspace.my_planetscale_keyspace '{"branch": "...", "database": "...", "name": "...", "organization": "..."}'
```
